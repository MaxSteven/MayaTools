New Tools Guy
[ ] - finish Weaver nodes that Mike didn't get to
[ ] - Weaver
	[ ] - cleanup
	[ ] - functionality improvements
	[ ] - more presentable, better UI
[ ] - Publishing Tool (depends on Caretaker 3)
[ ] - Houdini Digital Asset Publishing
[ ] - Houdini Digital Asset Browser
	[ ] - Houdini Engine Digital Asset loader for 3dsMax
	[ ] - Houdini Engine Digital Asset loader for Maya
[ ] - Translator for Houdini
	[ ] - creates entire scene in a single SOP node
	[ ] - reference parts of the Weaver graph by name as usual
		[ ] - ex: cougar001, car002, etc
[ ] - Translator for Nuke
	[ ] - scene is always connected to an "out" scene node that isn't deleted
	[ ] - nodes are created in a large Weaver backdrop
	[ ] - cameras, alembic files, etc are loaded w/ an Asset gizmo
	[ ] - Asset gizmo has button to Create Reference Asset
		[ ] - creates a linked-by-name copy of whatever is inside the asset
[ ] - Material editor
	[ ] - global material definition w/ all parameters expressed
	[ ] - editor provides color controls for maps, bakes the result
			- ex: saturation, contrast, brightness, hue shift, etc
	[ ] - preview in Fabric / VRay RT / Maxwell Fire
			- last two will likely require SDK work
[ ] - Cleaner
	[ ] - migrate asset versions from fast storage to slow storage to eventual deletion
	[ ] - query each shot's weaver and get a list of all used assets
		[ ] - alembic caches, textures used by materials, etc
	[ ] - mark older, unused versions for deletion
[ ] - "Deletion" queue
	[ ] - tries to "delete" files until it succeeds or is cleared
	[ ] - "delete"s files by moving them from fast storage to slow storage
	[ ] - files are deleted permanently once the job is archived
	[ ] - files that won't delete are auto-removed after a week of trying
	[ ] - tries to delete files it fails on once every 10 min or so
[ ] - Revert to this version
	[ ] - provides functionality for going back to old versions
	[ ] - looks for the files on fast storage, if it doesn't find them there, looks for them on slow storage
	[ ] - publishes files from wherever they were found as the latest version


Weaves
---------
- one .weave per shot

Qoros Example:
- shot generation script
	- run once plates are exported
	- creates assets for any plates it finds
	- creates a weave w/ the plate assets imported if no weave is found
- open qoros/workspaces/0010/weaver/0010_v001_xxx.weave (auto-created)
- plates are already in the weave via image sequence node
- image sequence nodehas a create camera asset button
	- creates camera asset: cam_0010_main
	- asset that linked to this plate asset
	- creates a stub track file in the format of your choosing
- importAsset: rig_car_qoros
- use publish tool inside of Weaver to create a new animation asset
	- creates asset: anim_0010_car
	- creates a stub file in the format of your choosing (.max, .mb, etc)
- car animation
	- open anim_0010_car.mb
	- translate scene
	- animate the cars
	- publish that animation from Maya
- scene assembly
	- in weaver, apply animation node
	- pick published animation
	- importAsset: env_saltFlats
	- importAsset: light_sunlight
	- importAsset: light_saltFlatsDome




Publish Tool
----------------
- translator drive
- app independent
- also runs standalone for publishing stuff that doesn't allow Python (Photoshop, AE, etc)
- lists current shot assets, project assets, and global assets by type
- publish new version from wherever
	- create in max, modify in maya, modify more in zbrush, publish anywhere
- variety of publish types
	- native (essentially save selected)
	- alembic
	- openVDB
	- image
- database updated on publish to latest version
- two tabs, create new asset and publish existing asset
	- create new asset has a rigid form to maintain naming convention
- likely web-based interface fed by PySide
	- will need to investigate this further
- can remote-publish a new version
	- promote working locally and only publishing once you're finished
- asset reader in weaver checks locally checks network
-
