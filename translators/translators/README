Interaction with Weaver:
Translator takes in a weaver, which has a currentScene attributes.

Then it gets all the nodes from the current sceen, and makes a dictionary mapping entityIDs to entities.  Entities with the same ID will be instances.

Then it cycles through the keys in the dictionary and instantiates one of each entity, and then instances it the appropriate number of times.  After that it cycles through all the entities and applies its properties and transformations.  Same for the instances.

To apply properties, there is a cascade function call from most specific to least specific.  Translator checks for a function called <type>_set<property>, then set<property>, then just setProperty.  For example, if we were trying to set the height of a box, translator would check for box_setHeight, then setHeight, then setProperty('height') if neither of those existed.  This allows the translator to implement to different degrees of specificity in different programs.  It is useful.
